# Recipes App Project

A project to find many different recipes (meals and drinks) from an API. You can find recipes by ingredient, by name, by country and also find a random recipe. It's possible to start the recipe and check each item you already added to the recipe, then set the recipe as finished to add it to your made recipes. The user can set each recipe as favorite and share the link of it.
